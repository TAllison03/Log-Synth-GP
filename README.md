# Log-Synth-GP

This repository contains a tool that uses Boolean Difference math to find internal Observability Don't Cares (ODC) and optimize logic circuits.

## Branches
There is a second branch titled experimental. If you want to see some of our test code, it is in that branch. All of our main code written by us is in the main branch

## Compilation Process

### Essential build requirements
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Clone ABC Repo inside this project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc.git
```

### Compile ABC Library
```bash
cd abc
make libabc.a
cd ..
```

### If SIS won't run
You might not have 32bit support. Try:
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libc6:i386
```

## Usage

```bash
# Compile the optimizer
make

# Run the optimizer
./optimizer {your blif filepath}

# Clean any compiled files or temporary .blif files
make clean
```

This implementation is not 100% correct

## Additional Notes

- Many of the important functions for the optimizer were found as internal ABC functions, located in abc/src/aig/aig/aig.h
- func.blif and impl_1.blif are just two very simple example files. They are just to test functionality, not robustness.
- The tests folder contains more test circuits you can run to try the program out.
- We noticed that we get a -Wunused-function when compiling. This is from ABC's library, and while we could suppress this warning, I'd rather not suppress warnings.
- We tried running SIS ourselves with a script, but we couldn't get it to work automatically. We felt printing the exact commands and opening SIS for the user was our best bet.
